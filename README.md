# hello-world
This is my first Git repository created for training purposes
I'm an "old dog" trying to learn a new trick ;)
I'm also hoping to enhance my skills as a Data Scientist beyond being an export in a specific BI tool (in my case, DOMO), into more basic/generally available (and free) tools common in the industry.
